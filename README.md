# Introduction
This is a repo to host the gitbook files for kerloud series.

# How to edit and use
Before committing any changes, please verify the gitbook docs via local gitbook by:

	gitbook serve


Then we can push the files to mainpage by:

	bash autopub.sh

The mainpage usually takes 20 minutes to build at: <http://cloudkernel-tech.github.io>. Hence it's necessary to keep a gitbook online docs alternatively.

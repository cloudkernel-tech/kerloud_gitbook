## Specifications

| Metric | Specification | Remark |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
|Maximum continuous current in main board| 160A, typical | |
|Maximum continuous current for the DC 5V main port| 3A | |
|Maximum continuous current for the DC 5V Auxiliary port| 5A | |
|Maximum continuous current for the DC 14V Auxiliary port| 5A | |
|Input voltage range| DC 7.4~33.6V (2~8S Lipo battery) | |
|Size| 54mm\*54mm\*7mm | |
|Weight| 40g | including the dafault XT60 cable|

**Notes:**

(1) The default XT60 cable (12AWG) allows norminal 30A and maximum 60A current, and can be used for small current senarios only.

To support a maximum 160A continuous current, users have to change the cable and corresponding battery connectors. The recommended configuration is:

cable: 1/0 AWG or higher;

battery connector: ANCHI 175A600V dual pole connector.

(2) The 14V auxillary power port is enabled with 4~8S input voltage only. The 5V auxillary power is always available.
